# TryHackMe Pre-Security Progress — What I’ve Completed So Far

Over the past few days, I’ve been working through the TryHackMe Pre-Security path to build a solid foundation before moving into penetration testing.  
Below is a clean summary of the sections I’ve completed so far and what I’ve learned from each of them.

# 1. Introduction to Cyber Security

This section was my starting point and helped me understand how the cybersecurity field is structured and what different roles look like.

## Offensive Security
This introduced me to the attacker’s mindset — analyzing systems for weaknesses, understanding how vulnerabilities are found, and how ethical hackers use controlled exploitation to secure organizations.  
The main takeaway: offensive security requires creativity, patience, and problem-solving.

## Defensive Security
Here I learned how defenders protect systems through logs, monitoring, threat detection, policies, and incident response.  
Defensive work is more process-driven and relies heavily on visibility and consistent analysis.

## Careers in Cybersecurity
I explored different career paths, including:
- SOC Analyst  
- Penetration Tester  
- Threat Hunter  
- DFIR  
- Malware Analyst  
- Cloud Security  

This gave me a clear understanding of where different skills fit into the industry and helped me identify areas I want to grow into.

# 2. Network Fundamentals

This section gave me a strong technical base and helped me understand how devices communicate across networks.

## What is Networking
I learned how computers exchange data using IP addressing, routing, and switching.  
Understanding how data moves across networks is essential for both attacking and defending systems.

## Introduction to LAN
LANs are internal networks like homes, colleges, or offices.  
I now understand the difference between:
- switches (handle internal traffic)
- routers (connect LANs to external networks)

## OSI Model
This section taught me to think about networking in layers.  
Breaking down communication into layers makes troubleshooting and understanding attacks much easier.

## Packets and Frames
This part explained:
- Packets carry IP-level information  
- Frames carry MAC-level information  

Seeing the difference helped me visualize what actually moves across a network.

## Extending Your Network
This covered how networks scale using routers, switches, subnets, and access points.  
It gave me a clearer picture of how enterprise environments are built.

# 3. How the Web Works

This section tied together networking fundamentals with how the internet actually functions.

## DNS in Detail
I learned how domain names get converted into IP addresses and how DNS queries move through:
- root servers  
- TLD servers  
- authoritative servers  

This section also highlighted why DNS is a common target for attacks.

## HTTP in Detail
Key things I understood:
- HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- status codes (200, 301, 404, 500, etc.)  
- how requests and responses are structured  
- cookies and why HTTP is stateless  

These concepts are directly relevant to web penetration testing.

## How a Website Works
This section connected frontend, backend, browsers, and servers.  
It helped me understand how data flows and why vulnerabilities appear at different stages.

## Putting It All Together
This summary made the entire process very clear:
1. User enters a URL  
2. DNS resolves the domain  
3. Browser sends an HTTP request  
4. Server responds  
5. Packets move through layers  
6. Browser renders the final webpage  

Understanding this full flow is crucial before moving to offensive web security.

# Summary of My Progress

So far, I’ve completed three main sections of the Pre-Security path:
- Introduction to Cyber Security  
- Network Fundamentals  
- How the Web Works  

I now have a solid foundation in networking basics, DNS/HTTP, and the core concepts behind cyber roles.  
Next, I’ll be starting **Linux Fundamentals** and **Windows Fundamentals**, where I plan to include screenshots and command examples as well.

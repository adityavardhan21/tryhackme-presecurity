## Day 1 — Search Skills (Nov 16, 2025)

Today I completed the **Search Skills** module from the Cyber101 path on TryHackMe.  
This module focused on developing the ability to find technical information quickly and accurately — a skill every cybersecurity professional depends on.

### What I learned

#### 🔍 Using Search Engines Effectively
I learned how to structure search queries to get relevant technical results faster:
- Using quotes `" "` for exact search terms  
- Using operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `-` to narrow down results  
- Searching for specific file types (e.g., `filetype:pdf`)  
- Searching within specific websites (e.g., `site:docs.python.org`)  

These are small but powerful techniques that save a lot of time when researching vulnerabilities, commands, protocols, or tools.

#### 📚 Reliable Technical Sources
The module reinforced the importance of referring to trusted and authoritative sources, such as:
- Official documentation pages  
- Developer blogs  
- Security research blogs  
- Vendor knowledge bases  
- Community forums (StackOverflow, Reddit, etc.)  

In cybersecurity, bad or outdated information can lead to mistakes, so learning how to filter sources is important.

#### 🔧 Searching for Commands, Errors & Tools
I practiced searching for:
- Linux/Windows commands and their usage  
- Specific error messages  
- Tool installation guides  
- CVE details  
- Security configurations  

The goal is to build the habit of researching **before** getting stuck.

### Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity requires constant learning. Threats evolve, tools update, and techniques change.  
Search skills help with:
- Troubleshooting  
- Understanding tools and exploits  
- Investigating vulnerabilities  
- Working faster during CTFs or real-world tasks  

Being able to find the right information quickly is a core skill for penetration testers, analysts, and defenders.

This completes Day 1 of my Cyber101 journey.  
Tomorrow, I will continue with the next topic and update this file with my progress.
